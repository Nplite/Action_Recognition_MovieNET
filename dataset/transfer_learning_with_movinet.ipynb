        "\n",
        "MoViNets (Mobile Video Networks) provide a family of efficient video classification models, supporting inference on streaming video. In this tutorial, you will use a pre-trained MoViNet model to classify videos, specifically for an action recognition task, from the [UCF101 dataset](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php). A pre-trained model is a saved network that was previously trained on a larger dataset. You can find more details about MoViNets in the [MoViNets: Mobile Video Networks for Efficient Video Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11511) paper by Kondratyuk, D. et al. (2021). In this tutorial, you will: \n",

        "* Create a new model using a pre-trained model with a new classifier by freezing the convolutional base of the MoViNet model\n",
        "* Replace the classifier head with the number of labels of a new dataset\n",
        "* Perform transfer learning on the [UCF101 dataset](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php)\n",

        "- [Build a 3D CNN model for video classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/video/video_classification). Note that this tutorial uses a (2+1)D CNN that decomposes the spatial and temporal aspects of 3D data; if you are using volumetric data such as an MRI scan, consider using a 3D CNN instead of a (2+1)D CNN.\n",
